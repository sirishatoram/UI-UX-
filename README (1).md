<!-- Project 1 -->
<h3 id="project1">Project 1: Smart Home Design</h3>
<p>
  This assignment focused on designing a complete smart home control web interface with a dark-theme–only approach. The goal was to create a clear, modern, and intuitive UI that allows users to monitor and manage devices across different rooms efficiently. It involved defining a structured navigation system, designing reusable UI components, and creating key screens such as the dashboard, room view, and device detail view. Special attention was given to interaction states, accessibility, and visual consistency within a dark theme. Overall, the assignment helped strengthen my understanding of system-based UI design and real-world application of UI/UX principles.

<!-- Project 2 -->
<h3 id="project2">Project 2: CRM application</h3>
<p>
  In this assignment, I designed a modern CRM web application interface focused on clarity, efficiency, and ease of use. I structured key modules such as dashboard, leads, customers, deals, tasks, and reports using standard SaaS design patterns. The design emphasizes clear navigation, visual hierarchy, and intuitive workflows to support sales and customer management activities. Through this task, I gained practical experience in designing complex data-driven interfaces and applying UI/UX principles to real-world business applications.

</p>

<!-- Project 3 -->
<h3 id="project3">Project 3: Redesign ebooks.com website</h3>
<p>
  In this task, I worked on redesigning the ebooks.com website to improve its usability, visual clarity, and overall user experience. I analyzed existing usability issues such as complex navigation, cluttered layouts, and weak visual hierarchy, and addressed them through a clean, modern design approach. The redesign focuses on simplified navigation, better content organization, and improved readability across devices. This task helped me strengthen my skills in usability analysis, user flow optimization, and design system consistency.

## **Learnings from LST and SST**

<!-- add your experiences over here -->
LST: LST at SURE Trust is about character, ethics, and mindset. Since the organization has roots in values-based education these sessions likely taught you:

Personality Branding: I didn't just learn to make a resume; I learned how to present "the best version of myself" to the world.

Lateral Thinking: In UI/UX, there is never just one solution. LST taught you how to think outside the box to solve user problems in ways others might miss.

The Spirit of Service: I learned that your work as a designer has a social impact. It’s not just about business; it’s about making life easier for people (especially rural or underserved users).

Resilience & Discipline: SURE Trust is known for being strict. LST helped you build the mental toughness to handle pressure, meet deadlines, and stay committed even when the work got hard.

SST: If LST was about who I am, SST was about how I interact. For a UI/UX designer, these are the skills that get your designs approved:

The Art of Communication: I learned that being a great designer is useless if I can't explain my ideas. SST taught me how to speak clearly, listen actively, and present my prototypes with confidence.

Mock Interviews & Grooming: I likely practiced how to handle tough questions and how to dress and behave in a professional setting.

## **Community Services**

As part of my community service activities, I actively participated in a tree plantation drive aimed at improving the local environment and promoting sustainability. This experience helped me understand the importance of environmental responsibility and collective action. In addition, I assisted elderly citizens by helping two senior individuals with their daily tasks and offering them basic support. These activities allowed me to develop empathy, social responsibility, and a sense of contribution toward the well-being of the community.
